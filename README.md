# WeatherAPI
An API for getting information from www.weather.com

The WeatherAPI will pull information about forecasts from www.weather.com. It will use an lxml and pyquery to parse the html in order to find the desired information.

Initial support is planned for Today's Forecast, a Five Day forecast, and a Ten Day forecast.

Output will include High and Low temps, Chance of Percipitation, Humidity, and an overall summary of the Outlook for the day.
